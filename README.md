## DX Demo 1: Source to Scratch

The goal of this demo is to get hands on experience with foundational aspects of the DX workflow.
It's intended to be written for anyone to be able to pick up the tools and follow along without
any prior experience. 

We'll focus on setting up your development environment, pulling metadata from a source repository, 
understanding the basic pieces of the SFDX project structure, pushing metadata to a new Scratch Org,
and pulling changes from the Scratch Org back to your local machine.

SFDX commands introduced for the first time are hyperlinked to Salesforce documentation for the command.
In most cases, there are more parameters available to a command than what we'll use in this demo.
